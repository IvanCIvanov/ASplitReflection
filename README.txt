Game Instructions
Welcome to A Split Reflection!
When you open the game, you’ll start on the title screen, where you can choose to start the game, view the credits, or quit.
This is a classic platformer adventure where you’ll use the arrow keys to move and the Z key to jump and shoot. Your enemies? The Ice Henchmen, in two forms: Chungus and Smol, who guard the castle under the command of their leader, the Ice King.
Your mission is to navigate through the Ice Castle’s dungeons and towers, overcoming traps and defeating enemies to face the Ice King and earn your freedom. Each level features a variety of platforms, some stable, some moving, and some shattering (but don’t worry, they reform after a short time). You’ll need to master these to explore and survive each area.
Every Henchman holds a magic mirror shard you MUST collect to escape. Once you’ve defeated all the Henchmen and gathered every shard, the mirror hidden in every room will magically fix itself, you can use it to teleport to the next level.
To make your journey easier, you can find power-ups hidden throughout the tower levels (but not the dungeons, so tread carefully!). These include upgrades like a double shot and higher jump height, perfect for taking down enemies and reaching new areas.
So what are you waiting for?! Jump into A Split Reflection RIGHT NOW and begin your escape from the Ice Castle!
Just remember, have fun, and don’t run out of lives!

Game Walkthrough
On the game’s title screen, press “Play” to get started! The goal of each level is to defeat all Henchmen and collect the shards they drop. Once the player collects every shard, the mirror is repaired and the player can progress to the next level.
  Tips for Dungeon Room 1:
  - There is a button in the top-left corner to activate moving platforms needed to reach the mirror.
  Tips for Dungeon Room 2:
  - This level is divided into two sides: left and right. Complete one side before moving onto the next.
  - Be careful when walking across crumbled platforms! They will disappear after a short time once the player touches them.
  Tips for Tower Room 1:
  - Make sure to collect the power-up! It will allow the player to shoot two projectiles instead of one.
  Tips for Tower Room 2:
  - Maze: use the buttons outside and inside the maze to move various walls and platforms to reach the Henchmen scattered around inside. There is a moving wall towards the top of the maze that essentially splits it in half. You must use the button inside the maze cleverly to be able to reach each Henchman.
  Tips for the Boss:
  - Watch the boss carefully for its snowball attack!
  - Be careful not to get too close, otherwise it will do a swipe attack.
  - The boss has 20 HP.
  - Once the boss reaches half its maximum health, it will become enraged, causing it to attack faster and more frequently.
